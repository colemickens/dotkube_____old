# polykube

A smattering of experiments including:

1. Kubernetes deployable services including:

2. A small Rust service (RUSTful, links)

3. A small Go service built with goa (right now it's just goa-cellar)

4. A "small" aspnet5 service

5. All in minimal containers

7. A minimal static ui that requires as little frontend (build/javascript) mess as possible.

Want to add:

1. grpc

2. letsencrypt

3. nixops definitions for a kube/az cluster

4.
